# About the project
This is a work in progress project, mainly involving 3DCAD, for a handheld directive antenna based on the HB9CV design. 


## Roadmap

- [ ] Make a new design with the welded radials.
- [ ] Make a list of the needed material and tools.
- [ ] Kindly ask ANSYS for radiation paterns. 
- [x] Ask Vash if attenuators might work in this application.
     - [x] Yes, it does, but apparently I cannot use switches to commute between the attenuators :(
- [ ] Actually make the thing.
- [ ] Make a 3D design of the handle.
